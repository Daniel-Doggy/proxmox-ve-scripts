# proxmox-ve-scripts
Proxmox VE scripts I make and use in Proxox VE

Note:
The install.sh is made for Proxmox VE 9!
Please do not use it for older versions.

WARNING:
I am switching from GitHub to my own git hosting.
This means that I will NOT provide new code to GitHub and instead push it to my own git repository.
If you plan on using these scripts I recommend to go to https://gitlab.danielhosting.nl/Daniel-Doggy/automation-scripts and get the latest changes from there.
